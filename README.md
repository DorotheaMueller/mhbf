# Assignments for Models of Higher Brain Functions

## Description
This is the course work for Models of Higher Brain Functions 2019/2020 at the TU Berlin. 

The topics of the sheets are as follows:
1. Visual Perception
2. Slow Feature Analysis
3. Learning Dynamics in Deep Linear Networks
4. Saliency Maps
5. Perceptual Bistability
6. Decision Making: Extension-Drift Model
7. Decision Making: Chapman-Kolmogorov
8. Reinforcement: Multi-Armed Bandit


## How to run
The jupyter notebooks are not dependent on each other and can be run individually. Most of them need numpy and matplotlib, so you might want to install these. Rarely, scipy and pyTorch are also used.
